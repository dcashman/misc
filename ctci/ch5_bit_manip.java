    /*
     *p1 - you are given 2 32 bit integers M & N and two bit positions, i & j.  Write a method to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i.  You ca nassume that bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M.  That is, if M=10011, you can assume that there ar eat least 5 bits between j and i.  You would not, for example, have j = 3 and i = 2, becaues M could not fully fit between bit 3 and 2.
